    # 2. auto generate memories:
    #     Implement an automated memory system that processes user chat history to extract both session-level and topic-level memories. The system should generate:
    #         Session Memories: At the end of each chat session (or after every 10 user messages), use an LLM to summarize key facts, goals, preferences, or entities mentioned by the user in that session.
    #         Topic Memories: Every few sessions (e.g. every 5 sessions), group existing session memories and summarize them into higher-level themes that represent recurring user interests or domains.
